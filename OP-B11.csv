182,23064614,BcMF11,"Author response: We are quite willing to  provide you with the sequene of BcMF11. But, recently, we found that this non-coding RNA does not exist as one copy in the Brassica genome. We are trying to isolate all of the copies. We think  we had better finish the isolation before we forwarding the sequences to you. What do you think?",-,-,-
